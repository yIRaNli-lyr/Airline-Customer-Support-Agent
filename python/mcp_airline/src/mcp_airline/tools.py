"""Tool registrations for the airline MCP server.

The goal of this module is to stay approachable for anyone extending the
codebase. The `register_tools` function is the single place where every tool is
declared. Each tool maps closely to an operation on the
``AirlineDatabase``—think of it as the contract between the MCP surface area and
your underlying data access layer.

When you add new behaviour, prefer creating small helper functions (similar to
``_search_direct_flight``) and keep the tool definitions focused on:

* validating parameters
* calling database helpers
* returning serialisable payloads (usually JSON strings)
