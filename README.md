# Agent with MCP Servers

This repository contains a very simple tool-calling agent with MCP support (Model Context Protocol)
to act as a airline customer service agent.

This project is based on the data and implementation of the [tau2-bench](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench) benchmark.

It contains both a TypeScript and a Python implementation. You can work with either.

## Prerequisites

Any model with modern OpenAI-compatible function calling abilities can be used. LiteLLM currently supports 972 of these models (see `python/agent/supported_models.py`). You are welcome to use any models; we have tested the assignment with Gemini models that provide free, rate-limited access. You can set the used model in the `config.ts` or `config.py` file. Rate limits can be configured in the same file.

Set up you API key (e.g., [Google API key](https://ai.google.dev) for Gemini model) as environment variable or in .env file.

## Project Structure

- `python/agent/` - Tool-calling agent with CLI and web UI and a benchmark implementation
- `python/mcp_airline/` - MCP server for airline domain (flights, reservations, user management), which also implements a web server to edit user profile data
- `data/` - Domain data (airline database, policies, tasks)

## Quick Start

1. Setup Environment: Create a `.env` or environment variable with your API key.
2. Start the MCP Airline Servers: The MCP servers are all implemented using the streaming http protocol, so when launched they are reachable over a URL in the format `http://localhost:[port]/mcp`. You can start multiple servers on different ports.
3. The MCP Inspector can be used to check that the server is running correctly. Run `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://localhost:3000/mcp`
4. Start the agent with the CLI or Web UI, passing the address of the MCP server as an argument.
5. Optionally, run the provided examples and evaluates success from the tau2 benchmark. For this, the user input is simulated with another LLM.


## RAG Pipeline & Policy Eval

1. **Ingest policy into Chroma** (run once; requires `airline_policy.pdf` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`):
   ```bash
   python ingest_policy.py
   ```
   This creates `policy_db/` with chunked, embedded policy.

2. **Run policy eval** (naive vs RAG; computes hallucination rate and reduction):
   ```bash
   agent-eval-policy                    # from python/agent after pip install -e .
   agent-eval-policy --limit 5          # quick check
   agent-eval-policy --out results.json # save results
   ```

3. **Use RAG in the agent** (policy QA via `query_policy` tool instead of full policy in prompt):
   ```bash
   agent-cli --rag http://localhost:3000/mcp
   ```
   Ensure the MCP airline server is running and ingest has been run.

## Development Notes

- All MCP servers share data from the `data/` directory
- The airline database is loaded from `data/airline/db.json`
- The policy is in `data/airline/policy.md`
- Changes to the database through the web UI or MCP tools are in-memory only (not persisted)
